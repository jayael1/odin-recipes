    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The following will describe how to make a normal pizza in the oven.
        No fancy ingredients needed, just a basic pepperoni pizza.</p>
    <p>My favorite thing on a Friday night during winter months is pizza and a movie. Something about it is so comforting after a busy week and reminds me of my childhood. So, here's my Easy Pizza at Home Recipe that's ready in under 3 hours and even better than frozen store-bought pizza!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Grated Aged Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Freshly sliced mozzarella</li>
        <li>Grated pecorino or parmesian</lie>
        <li>Fresh basil</li>
        <li>Cracked black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the warm water, sugar, and instant yeast. Mix just to combine and set aside for 5-10 minutes, until frothy</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil, milk, salt, and 3 cups flour to the stand mixer bowl. Using the hook attachment, mix on LOW speed for 2-3 minutes, until a shaggy dough. Increase speed to Medium to knead with the dough 3-5 minutes, until smooth and pliable. When you press a finger into the dough, it should slowly bounce back.</li>
        <li>Cover to rest 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2-3 pieces. Place in a greased baking pan, drizzle the tops with a little olive oil, then cover with plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm environment for 1.5 - 3 hours, depending on how cold your kitchen is. The dough should be doubled in size when ready to use.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500F for 30 minutes. Place the pizza rack in the oven to heat, as well</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cornmeal on a clean surface to help gently stretch out the pizza to have a thin bottom and 1/2" thick crust.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the pizza rack from the oven and place on a heat-safe surface. Add the stretched-out pizza dough onto the pizza rack.</li>
        <li>Drizzle lightly with olive oil, then spoon a thin layer of the pizza sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Add about 3/4 cups shredded mozzarella, 3-4 fresh mozzarella slices, and freshly grated pecorino or parmesan.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8-12 minutes, until golden and crispy to desired preference.</li>
        <li>Garnish with more freshly grated pecorino or parmesan, chopped basil, and cracked black pepper. Repeat with the remaining pizza doughs. Enjoy warm!</li>
